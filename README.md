Minimal Event Reactor

description
-----------
Reactor (i.e. "Event Loop").
        
Coded to help understand:
- Asynchronous programming
- Event emitter/listener pattern
- Event driven programming
- Callbacks (Continuation-passing style, CPS)

Inspired on nodejs, while learning it.

Minimalistic approach: only code what is needed to understand concepts.
